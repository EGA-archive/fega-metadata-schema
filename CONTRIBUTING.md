# Contributing to **fega-metadata-schema**

Thank you for your interest in improving the EGA metadata model!  We welcome pull-requests and issue reports from **FEGA nodes, downstream integrators, and the wider community**.  This document explains the conventions and workflow we follow in this repository.

> **Scope** – This repo contains JSON Schemas, JSON-LD contexts/frames, examples, validation utilities and documentation *specific to the EGA metadata model*.  Issues relating to other FEGA software (portal, download client, etc.) should be opened in their respective repositories. For general inquiries, please fill the [**Need-help form**](https://ega-archive.org/need-help/).

## 1  Ways to contribute

| Activity | How |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Report a bug**                        | Use the *Bug report* issue template. It collects schema/tool versions, reproduction steps, and expected vs. observed behaviour.       |
| **Suggest a change**              | Use the *Change request* issue template. Describe the use-case first, then a proposal (new property, enum value, structural change, etc.). |
| **Direct contributions**               | Open a pull-request containing the pertinent changes, and following the [PR template](./.github/pull_request_template.md). |
| **Ask a question / start a discussion** | Either create a [blank GH issue](https://github.com/EGA-archive/fega-metadata-schema/issues/new) or reach out to the community through the [ELIXIR FEGA Slack channel](https://elixir-europe.slack.com/archives/C05UHABF0CT). |

## 2  Before you start

* **Check existing [issues](https://github.com/EGA-archive/fega-metadata-schema/issues)/[PRs](https://github.com/EGA-archive/fega-metadata-schema/pulls)** – someone might be working on the same topic.
* **Follow the Code of Conduct** – be respectful and constructive.
* **Use descriptive titles** – this helps triaging and search.
* **Provide detailed descriptions** – this helps fixing or improving the content faster.

## 3  Pull-request workflow

1. **Fork** the repository (or create a feature branch if you have push rights).
2. Create a **topic branch** off ``main`` or ``dev``, e.g. `feat/add-sample-tissue-enum`.
3. Make your changes and verify locally that files within ``schemas/entities/*/examples`` validate against the local schemas. The **easiest way to do this** is by manually triggering the ``json_validation_deploying_biovalidator.yml`` workflow at its [Actions](https://github.com/M-casado/fega-metadata-schema/actions/workflows/json_validation_deploying_biovalidator.yml) page. You can provide the branch (e.g., ``my-branch``), commit or tag in the form (see image below) and the workflow will do the rest for you (just check the outcome!). You can run actions on this workflow only as an active contributor, but you can replicate this by forking the repository and running the action in your own fork.

4. **Update metadata artefacts** if you changed schemas:
   * Either manually trigger [``check-schema-diff.yml``](.github/workflows/check-schema-diff.yml) or run [``schema-diff.py``](scripts/py/schema-diff.py) directly. Both will give you an idea of what semantic versioning changes correspond to the schemas.
   * Increment the `meta:version` field of each JSON Schema.
   
5. **Add or update data / docs** so behaviour is demonstrably correct.
6. **Amend `CHANGELOG.md`** under the *Unreleased* section.
7. Commit with a **clear message** (`type(scope): summary`, e.g. `feat(schema): add new library_strategy enum values`).
8. Push and **open the PR**.  The pull-request template will guide you through the last checks.

### Review & merge rules

* Two approving reviews from maintainers are required.
* CI **must pass** (e.g., lints, validation).
* Squash-and-merge is preferred unless history needs to be preserved.

## 4  Coding & style guidelines

| Area                | Tool / Convention   |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Python**          | Type hints encouraged; keep reusable logic in `src/fega_tools/`.          |
| **JSON Schemas**    | `$id`, `title`, `description` and `meta:version` are mandatory; use `$ref` over copy-paste. More details at [``schemas/entities``](./schemas/entities/README.md). |
| **Commit messages** | Conventional Commits style (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:` …).                                       |
| **Docs**            | Markdown (`.md`), diagrams as SVG/PNG in `docs/images/`.                                      |
