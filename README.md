Machine-readable definitions of the **European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) metadata model**, together with examples, JSON-LD resources, validation utilities, and documentation.

The resources in this repository help you to:

* **Validate** metadata against the EGA metadata model locally.
* **Integrate** EGA-compatible metadata into your own pipelines.
* **Explore** the structure, relationships, and linked-data semantics of the EGA metadata model.

## Overview of repository structure

Shared schema definitions live in [`schemas/common/`](./schemas/common/). Third-party JSON Schema and RDF/SHACL resources are kept under [`standards/`](./standards/) with their own licensing notes.

Each EGA entity schema ([`schemas/entities/`](./schemas/entities/)) is paired with local examples, a JSON-LD context, and a JSON-LD frame. The validation scripts ([`scripts/`](./scripts/)) use those files together to check JSON Schema validity, JSON-LD parsing, context/frame coverage, RDF reconstruction, and SHACL compatibility where applicable.

## Setup

The Python validation scripts expect the repository helper package and dependencies to be installed:

```bash
# Optional if you don't want to affect root
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Some validation commands also expect an already-running [Biovalidator fork](https://github.com/M-casado/biovalidator/tree/main) endpoint. From the repository root, start Biovalidator with the local schemas loaded:

```bash
# Optionally, uninstall any previous global Biovalidator installation
# npm uninstall -g biovalidator
npm install -g "github:M-casado/biovalidator#main"
node "$(npm root -g)/biovalidator/src/biovalidator.js" \
  --port 3020 \
  --ref "./schemas/**/schema.json" \
  --ref "./schemas/**/*.schema.json" \
  --ref "./standards/json-schema/**/*.json"
```

## Validation

### Complete Schema and Example Suite

Run **all** valid and invalid metadata JSON (e.g., [`cohort-valid-detailed-study-defined.json`](./schemas/entities/cohort/examples/valid/cohort-valid-detailed-study-defined.json)) examples under `schemas/entities`:

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_examples.py -v
```

The script exits with code `0` if all suites pass and `1` otherwise. No output is printed to stdout by default; add `--print-summary` to get the full JSON report:

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_examples.py --root schemas/entities --print-summary
```

To save the report to a file instead of (or in addition to) printing it, use `--summary-dir`:

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_examples.py --root schemas/entities --summary-dir .
```

Validate a single entity (e.g., all ``cohort`` examples):
```bash
python scripts/py/validate_examples.py --root schemas/entities --entity cohort
```

See more options:
```bash
python scripts/py/validate_examples.py --help
```

### JSON-LD Context Smoke Tests

Check that every valid example can be parsed into RDF (with `rdflib`) and that required JSON-LD fields (`data.@context`, `data.@type`, `schema.$ref`) are present. This step resolves all context references from local files (i.e., we are not fetching from the remote, which is what normal RDF parsing would do) and does **not** require Biovalidator.

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_contexts.py -v
```

See more options:
```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_contexts.py --help
```

A passing test confirms that (1) the **local context chain** (i.e., a JSON doc referencing the JSON Schema, which references the JSON-LD context) is self-consistent, that (2) at least **one type statement** (e.g., ``"@type": "ega:cohort"``) **expands** to an RDF triple (e.g., ``ega:EGAH00000000001 --> rdf:type --> ega:cohort``), and that (3) the document can be parsed into a **non-empty RDF graph**, entirely from local files. 

It does **not** verify that every term in the document is defined in the context (undefined terms are silently ignored by JSON-LD), nor that the expanded URIs are dereferenceable or semantically correct.

### JSON-LD Context and Frame Coverage

Check that every direct property declared in each entity's `schema.json` is covered by its materialized JSON-LD context (`context.jsonld`) and its frame (`frame.jsonld`). The goal is to catch schema terms that would otherwise be ignored during JSON-LD parsing or framing (i.e., added to the schemas but not to the contexts and frames).

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_coverage.py -v
```

See more options:
```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_coverage.py --help
```

### JSON-LD Frame Validation

Confirm that every valid example can be reconstructed from both flattened JSON-LD and a generated RDF graph into schema-shaped JSON-LD, without semantic RDF loss, and then pass Biovalidator.

This requires a running Biovalidator instance and a `frame.jsonld` file inside each entity directory. Missing frames fail the suite.

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_frames.py -v
```

Use single-file debug mode to print complete snapshots after each transformation stage to stdout. This helps figuring out how the transformations work during the tests. Normal log records remain on stderr:

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_frames.py \
  --file schemas/entities/cohort/examples/valid/cohort-valid-minimal-study-defined.json \
  -vv
```

See more options:
```bash
python scripts/py/validate_jsonld_frames.py --help
```

### RDF/SHACL Example Suite

Validate wrapped JSON-LD examples against RDF/SHACL shapes. This does not require Biovalidator.

The test scope (i.e., which entities we are validating in each run) is explicit, since for now we only have the HealthDCAT-AP SHACL shapes that apply to Datasets only. For example:

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_rdf_shacl.py \
  --entity dataset \
  --shapes standards/rdf/healthdcat-ap/release-6.0.0/shacl/non-public-shapes-v6.ttl \
  -v
```

See more options:
```bash
python scripts/py/validate_rdf_shacl.py --help
```

### Validate One JSON Document

For one-off validation, wrap the JSON data and target schema in a document with top-level `data` and `schema` keys. For example, to validate a `cohort` (i.e., the data representing an EGA Cohort entity) against the `cohort` schema:

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "$ref": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGA-archive/fega-metadata-schema/dev/schemas/entities/cohort/schema.json"
  },
  "data": {
    "@context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGA-archive/fega-metadata-schema/dev/schemas/entities/cohort/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "ega:cohort",
    "id": "ega:EGAC00001000001",
    "name": "Example rare disease cohort"
  }
}
```

Then validate that wrapper document with a running Biovalidator instance:

```bash
python scripts/py/validate_metadata.py <path/to/document.json>
```
